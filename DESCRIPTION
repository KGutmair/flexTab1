Description: This package provides functions for quickly generating summary statistics for both 
             categorical and numeric variables, either for a single group or stratified across 
             multiple groups, including a Table 1. The key advantage of this package lies in its 
             flexibility: users can choose from a wide range of summary measures (e.g., median, 
             mean, standard deviation, and more) to display. Additionally, options are available 
             to visualize the frequency of missing values per variable, p-values and/or standardized 
             mean differences. Users can also decide whether to output a publication-ready table 
             using the flextable package or a simple data frame for further customization of the layout.
