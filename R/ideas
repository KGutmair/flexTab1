# Documentation:
# Title: should be short, the first letter in capital letters and in "verb style"
select(): Keep or drop columns using their names and types
arrange(): Order rows using column values

# Description: The purpose of the description is to summarize the goal of the function, usually in a single paragraph

# Return value
A function’s output is as important as its inputs. Documenting the output is the job of the @returns10 tag. Here the priority is to describe the overall “shape” of the output, i.e. what sort of object it is, and its dimensions (if that makes sense)
For example, if your function returns a vector you might describe its type and length, or if your function returns a data frame you might describe the names and types of the columns and the expected number of rows
